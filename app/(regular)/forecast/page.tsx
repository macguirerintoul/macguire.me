				<h2>Highlights</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>designed, developed, and published an open-source desktop app</li>
					<li>learned Vue and Electron</li>
					<li>got dark mode working ðŸ˜Ž</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Opportunity</h2>
				One day in 2019, I found myself with several tasks to complete across
				work, school, and my personal life. Some of them were big, some of them
				were small. I wanted to know how long I had to complete each of them, so
				I could prioritize accordingly. While there are plenty of apps that make
				lists, there were none that I knew of that count down to a due date. I
				decided to learn Vue and Electron and make myself an app.
				<h2>Outcome</h2>
				<p>
					<a href="https://forecast.macguire.me">Forecast</a> is a
					cross-platform desktop app that helps manage tasks. That&apos;s really
					all there is to it.

					orientation="media-right"
					content="Add tasks to your to-do list, and Forecast shows you the time remaining until each one is due."
