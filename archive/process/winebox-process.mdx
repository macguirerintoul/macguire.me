To better understand the opportunity, we interviewed five semi-serious wine collectors and collected surveys from eighteen. From this research, we were able to identify wants and frustrations, and better understand the ways in which wine was part of people's lives.

In order to better serve collectors, we focused on addressing frustrations that were brought up consistently when they were asked about their collections. The source of many struggles seemed to be that people couldnâ€™t remember the details that they wanted in that moment. This led us to frame the challenge:

> How might we help people keep tabs on their collections and avoid losing the details?

Further research revealed that people engage with wine in a variety of contexts; at home, at dinner with friends, at liquor stores. We also noted that people could make use of their collection information in any of these contexts.

> How might we provide a companion for the various situations that surround wine?

We mapped out our persona's experience across common wine-related situations to identify frictions and opportunities.

The experience map included different contexts of use, although we ultimately ended up designing for use at home.
