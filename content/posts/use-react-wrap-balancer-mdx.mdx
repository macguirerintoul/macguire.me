title: Use React Wrap Balancer for MDX headings

I wanted to use [React Wrap Balancer](https://github.com/shuding/react-wrap-balancer) to improve headings in my MDX blog posts. I could have imported `Balancer` and put it around all my headings, but I wanted the computer to do that for me.

Initially, I thought a Remark plugin would do the trick, but after a brief search, I couldn't find a plugin that would swap elements with React components.

Shortly after, I found myself on the [`next-mdx-remote`](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) docs, and I [discovered something even simpler](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote#replacing-default-components).

`next-mdx-remote` provides direct support for replacing elements, so I replaced `h2` (and other headings) using the following:

```ts
const components = {
	h2: (props: { children: ReactNode }) => (
		<h2>
			<Balancer>{props.children}</Balancer>
		</h2>
	),
};

<MDXRemote {...source} components={components} />;
```
