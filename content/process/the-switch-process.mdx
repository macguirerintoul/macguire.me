After identifying business problems within the menstrual cup market, we identified frictions with Lena's existing website. Information was scattered across multiple pages, and neglected to highlight the product’s extensive benefits. We then conducted a survey to understand peoples' perception of cups and the factors influencing this perception, in order to design a digital experience that encouraged visitors to try the product.

After considering the various opportunities for this project as well as its scope and timeframe, we focused on addressing the apprehensions of potential customers.

We then developed personas from common themes in our research: we chose to design for the 'Accustomed & Uncertain' menstruator, who uses other menstrual products and does not know enough about cups to switch over.

The nature of the product lends itself to a rocky customer journey. Our research suggests the struggle of switching is recognized by the majority of cup users, but is said to be well worth it. Considering the business problems, we chose to address the pre-purchase stages and aimed to convey the value of menstrual cups more effectively.

### Consideration

Lena's current site has a stories section, but doesn't feature any content related to personal experiences with cups. We found this was a missed opportunity, seeing as based on the number of reviews and discussion online, cup users love to share their stories. Our research also suggested that if people could see how using a cup would impact their lifestyle, they would feel more comfortable with them.

Our survey of over 450 respondents suggested that most customers were convinced to try a menstrual cup by a close friend or sibling. To create a meaningful experience, the team decided to strategize content from the perspective of a supportive, older sister. As the content strategist, I ensured that all content followed this principle and had a consistent tone and attitude.

### Ongoing use

As advertised on their site, Lena is happy to have representatives answer any questions their customers have, or give advice to those just starting out. To make sure customers feel taken care of, Lena can reach out and ask how things are going. When customers write positive reviews, Lena could ask them to share their story on the Lena website and continue the cycle.
