summary: "<a href='https://visier.com' target='_blank'>Visier</a> is the leader in People Analytics; a fancy term for using workforce data to answer questions and make better business decisions. Things like: do employees who complete training perform better? Which managers have the highest turnover rates? Are we paying people equitably? I design planning & analytics experiences for our platform, used by over 15,000 organizations to improve results in employee experience, retention, talent acquisition, and more."
