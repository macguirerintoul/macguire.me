summary: "Visier's first scatter plots were built during a time of rapid growth, so competing priorities meant  several usability issues and functionality additions were left unaddressed. For the Fall 2019 release, we revised these visuals, adding functionality like semantic highlighting, secondary groupings, and support for a 'quadrant' chart. We also addressed usability issues like the lack of data labels, oversized dots in some configurations, and technology limitations. The upgraded visualizations have been used in Visier's Guidebooks and by organizations all over the world."

## Highlights

- shipped the improvements in Visier's [Fall 2019 release](https://www.visier.com/fall-2019-release/)
- showcased the redesign at a company-wide product demo session
- the improved visual was leveraged in Visier's Guidebooks and [featured in marketing sites](https://www.visier.com/now/retention/)

## Contributions

- **Understanding requirements:** To identify the work to be done, I facilitated conversations with Solution Managers to understand the friction points they, and customers, had with the existing visuals.
- **Interaction design:** I then designed interaction and interface improvements for the visuals in Visier's web and mobile apps, including free-form data exploration workflows as well as "data journalism" workflows.
- **Developer collaboration:** Once a proposal was formed, I collaborated with our development team to deliver the project.

## Opportunity

Customers and Visier solution authors weren't able to use the visuals to their full potential due to functionality and usability limitations. The 'wish list' was as follows:

1. Make them easier to read (improve visual design)
2. Make them more meaningful (add semantic highlighting options)
3. Make them easier to explore (make zooming/panning affordances more discoverable)
4. Make them more powerful (secondary grouping, time comparison)

## Outcome

The Relationship and Quadrant visuals are the result of our work on improving the usability and functionality of Visier's scatter plots.

A Quadrant visual, featuring data labels, average thresholds, and zoom controls.

Semantic highlights & labels can be added to quadrants to give viewers more context about what they're seeing.
