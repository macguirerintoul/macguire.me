title: Custom MDX headings with rehype-slug

When I added [`rehype-slug`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-slug) to my Next.js project, it didn't seem to be working right. No `id`s were being added to my headings.

I then remembered I was using [custom components](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote#replacing-default-components) for headings, since I wanted to put a [`<Balancer>`](https://github.com/shuding/react-wrap-balancer) inside them.

I inspected the compiled MDX, and saw that `rehype-slug` was adding `id`s to headingsâ€”but when that compiled MDX was passed to `<MDXRemote>`, the headings were being replaced with my custom component, losing the `id` in the process.

All I had to do to fix it was pass the `id` through to my custom component:

```ts
const components = {
	h2: (props: { id?: string; children?: ReactNode }) => (
		<h2 id={props.id}>
			<Balancer>{props.children}</Balancer>
		</h2>
	),
	// ...
};
```
