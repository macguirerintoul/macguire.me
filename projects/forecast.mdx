# Forecast

## Highlights

- designed, developed, and published an open-source desktop app
- learned Vue and Electron
- got dark mode working ðŸ˜Ž

## Opportunity

One day in 2019, I found myself with several tasks to complete across work, school, and my personal life. Some of them were big, some of them were small. I wanted to know how long I had to complete each of them, so I could prioritize accordingly. While there are plenty of apps that make lists, there were none that I knew of that count down to a due date. I decided to learn Vue and Electron and make myself an app.

## Outcome

[Forecast](https://forecast.macguire.me) is a cross-platform desktop app that helps manage tasks. That's really all there is to it.
