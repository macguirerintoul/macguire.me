Impress lets users create digital impressionist "paintings" of their photos. It uses an adaptation of Peter Litwinowicz' image processing algorithm described in [Processing Images and Video for An Impressionist Effect](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/258734.258893). The project was completed as part of IAT 455: Computational Media at SFU [SIAT](https://www.sfu.ca/siat.html).
