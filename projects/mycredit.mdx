summary: "Despite the importance of credit in personal finance, an estimated 56% of Canadians have never checked their credit score and 31% don't know how to improve their score (<a href='https://newsroom.bmo.com/2015-02-27-Out-of-Sight-Out-of-Mind-Over-Half-of-Canadians-Have-Never-Checked-Their-Credit-Score'>BMO, 2016</a>). We saw this as an opportunity to support people in learning about credit through a mobile app offered by Vancity, a local credit union. The project was sent to Vancity directors, who invited us to present to their Digital Services team at their head office in Vancouver."

	Financial literacy is an important component of all of our products and
	services at Vancity. The app demonstrated the unique financial needs of our
	members and community, with excellent design and a modern take on Vancity
	branding. This project inspired our Digital team to push for new user
	experiences. It is clear that the product was well researched and would
	produce the results that the team wanted.
