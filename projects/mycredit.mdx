	Financial literacy is an important component of all of our products and
	services at Vancity. The app demonstrated the unique financial needs of our
	members and community, with excellent design and a modern take on Vancity
	branding. This project inspired our Digital team to push for new user
	experiences. It is clear that the product was well researched and would
	produce the results that the team wanted.
