My first experience with a server was uploading an HTML document using FileZilla (I was 11). I've learned a lot since then.

At home I use Proxmox, and I generally go for Ubuntu when I need a VM. To keep things simple, I prefer running services in Docker when I can.

Professionally, my work has been on RHEL, managing various services and applications. I've upgraded PHP versions, migrated VMs, moved around WordPress sites, and fixed broken plugins.

Feel free to [contact me](/contact) if you need some work done.
