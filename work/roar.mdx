summary: "<a href='http://vch.ca' target='_blank'>Vancouver Coastal Health</a> trains around 1000 new staff per year, but was processing all new hires with manual document editing and data entry. To modernize the workflow, I worked alongside the Clinical Education and Recruitment Services teams to design and develop a web app to automate each employee’s schedule and manage education sessions. The new process saves over 750 hours of labour each year."

## Highlights

- reduced 750 hours of labour per year, freeing up staff to work on more meaningful projects
- learned Laravel and brushed up on my React skills

## Contribution

As the sole member of my team working on the project, I was responsible for user experience design, interface design, project management, and full-stack development. I regularly met with users and stakeholders to ensure the project was usable and fulfilled requirements, and balanced business needs and user experience.

## Opportunity

Vancouver Coastal Health is responsible for the training of over 15 thousand healthcare staff and volunteers. The process of registering a newly-hired employees into their mandatory training sessions involved numerous emails, PDF forms, manual data entry into multiple spreadsheets, and hand-editing a Word template to create each employee’s training schedule.

## Outcome

In order to modernize the workflow, I worked alongside the Clinical Education and Recruitment Services teams to design and develop a web app to generate each employee’s schedule and manage education sessions.
